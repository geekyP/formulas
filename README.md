# formulas

1. Sum of n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2
2. Slope of a line = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
3. Distance between two points on a line = sqrt(pow((x2 - x1),2) - pow((y2 - y1),2))
4. Permutation without repitition = n!/(n - r)! where n is the number of items to choose from and r is the number of slots to fill
5. Permutation with repitition = pow(n,r) where n is the number of items to choose from and r is the number of slots to fill
6. Combination = n!/(n - r)!r! where n is the number of items to choose from and r is the number of slots to fill
